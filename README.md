# Wind-Mill-Power-Prediction
Objective :
The objective is to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the power that is generated (in KW/h) based on the various features provided in the dataset. To analyze and implement multiple algorithms and determine which is more appropriate for a problem To get hands-on experience in Machine Learning problems.

Problem Statement :
It is the year 2022 and we are at the verge of a massive climatic change. With global warming at its peak and fossil fuels inching towards its extinction, it is the need of the hour to step up and take responsibility for our planet. Developing countries all over the world are making a shift towards a cleaner energy source and are looking at ways to expand their global energy source power.

Switching to renewable energy sources is a great way to reduce dependency on imported fuels and increase cost efficiency. It is time we move towards a low-carbon future by embracing solar, hydro, geothermal energy and so on, to protect mother nature.

An efficient energy source that has been gaining popularity around the world is wind turbines. Wind turbines generate power by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind. Factors such as temperature, wind direction, turbine status, weather, blade length, and so on influence the amount of power generated.

Description :

Step 1 : Data preparation, Data cleaning, Univariate and Bivariate analysis, Missing value imputation and Feature engineering to get the cleaned data.

Step 2 : We have fitted the following models on the cleaned data and evaluated the performance of each model using cross validation and hyperparameter tuning :

1. Simple Linear Regression with each individual feature
2. Multiple linear regression by forward selection and backward elimination
3. Decision tree with hyperparameter tuning
4. Bagging Regressor model
5. Random Forest regressor model with hyperparameter tuning.
6. XGBoost Regressor model.
